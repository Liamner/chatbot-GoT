# A chatbot of GoT
This chat bot is a project done with [botonic](https://botonic.io/).

This is make using the following public APIs:
- https://anapioficeandfire.com/
- http://lebowski.me (The server is down)

## How it works?
When a user talks for the first time, the bot shows the differents Game of Thrones Houses. If you click in one of them, you will see the words form that house.

If the user says anything, the bot will simply say 'Quote!'. (Note that it should say a random Big Lebowski quote but the server is down)
